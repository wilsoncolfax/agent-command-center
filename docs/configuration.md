# Configuration

Config lives in your OS user config dir (`~/Library/Application Support/agent-manager/config.toml` on macOS, `~/.config/agent-manager/config.toml` on Linux, with `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` honored when set) and is created on first run with defaults for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Grok Build, Gemini CLI, Pi, Command Code, and Hermes Agent.

The Pi defaults require Pi 0.76.0 or later because they use `--session-id`.

The Hermes defaults are tested with Hermes Agent 0.20.0 and launch its classic REPL with `--cli`. This keeps the input, approval, and activity markers stable even when your Hermes preference selects its modern TUI.

Top-level: `poll_interval` (default `"2s"`) sets how often panes are polled for status, preview, and stats. `editor` is the command `o` opens a directory in, arguments included (`editor = "code -n"`, `editor = "open -a 'Visual Studio Code'"`); it is run directly rather than through a shell, and quotes group an argument carrying a space. Left unset, Agent Manager falls back to `$AGENT_MANAGER_EDITOR`, then a GUI editor on `PATH`, then `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` (see [Opening the editor](usage.md#opening-the-editor)).

The generated file also carries a `[tools.terminal]` block. That one is the shell `T` opens, not an agent CLI: an empty `command` leaves the pane on `$SHELL`, and setting one opens a different shell. `shell = true` is what marks it — never the name — so the tool pickers skip it and the keys that write into a pane refuse it (see [Terminal tabs](usage.md#terminal-tabs)). Any block can carry the flag, and a `[tools.terminal]` block already in your own config keeps whatever it already means.

Add any CLI tool as a `[tools.<name>]` block:

```toml
[tools.mytool]
command = "mytool"
default_status = "idle"
rules = [
  { state = "working", pattern = "esc to interrupt" },
  { state = "errored", pattern = "(?im)^\\s*error:" },
]
```

Rules match top-down against the visible pane text; first match wins, and `default_status` applies when nothing matches.

**Status detection.** Optional per-tool fields refine it: `activity_cutoff` (regex locating the tool's input box, everything above it is turn content), `turn_end` (a turn-summary line marking the turn as over), `busy_line` (work that outlives its turn, such as background agents and shells), `limit_line` (a usage or rate-limit banner; the session is `errored`), `dialog_footer` (a line only an open dialog draws under the input marker, so a dialog that reuses that marker for its selected option is not read as a typed draft), `chrome_line`, `blocked_line`, and `trailing_note`. One field serves the focus view's arrow step (`left` leaving focus at the prompt head): `input_prefix` declares the composer's own row for tools the cutoff cannot serve there: pi composes on a bare blank row between rules, and opencode on a gutter row whose bar its cutoff does not match. `composer_placeholder` serves the tools whose terminal cursor never enters the composer: it names the placeholder an empty composer paints (command-code parks the real cursor below its footer and draws its own), and left leaves focus only while that placeholder is on screen. `status_source = "claude-hooks"` switches status to Claude Code hook events (see [Status](usage.md#status)). The generated config's `claude`, `opencode` and `command-code` blocks show all of them in use.

**Revive.** `resume_by_id_command` resumes one exact conversation, with `{id}` replaced by the session's captured agent id. That id comes either from launching under an id the manager mints (`session_id_flag`, e.g. `--session-id`) or from reading back an id the tool minted itself (`session_store = "codex" | "opencode" | "gemini" | "hermes" | "command-code"`). `resume_picker_command` launches the tool's own session picker when no id is available, so the user chooses the conversation in the pane (`claude --resume`, `codex resume`, `cmd --resume`, `pi --resume`, bare `grok`, `gemini -i /resume`, `hermes --cli sessions browse`) instead of the blind `revive_command` fallback (`claude --continue`). opencode's picker lives only inside the running TUI, so its default pairs the bare launch with `resume_picker_keys = "/sessions"`, which Agent Manager types at the composer once it shows. Agent Manager shell-quotes `{id}`, as it does for a fork, so write the placeholder bare: `codex resume {id}`.

**Forks.** `fork_command` creates a conversation from an existing session. Agent Manager replaces and shell-quotes these placeholders:

- `{id}`: The source conversation ID.
- `{session_file}`: The source conversation's file on disk, for a tool that forks by loading a file (Gemini CLI: `gemini --session-file`). Available with `session_store = "gemini"`.
- `{new_id}`: A new UUID that Agent Manager records for exact revival.
- `{name}`: The new Agent Manager session name.

A `fork_command` references its source through `{id}` or `{session_file}`, so one of those two is required. Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Grok, Gemini CLI, Pi, and Command Code include default fork commands. A custom tool can omit `{new_id}` when its `session_store` captures the generated ID.

**Prompts.** `prompt_flag` controls how the new-session form's optional prompt is embedded into the launch command. Tools that take the prompt as a positional argument (Claude Code: `claude 'the prompt'`) leave it empty; tools whose positional argument means something else declare the flag (OpenCode: `prompt_flag = "--prompt"`, since its positional argument is the project path). `prompt_mode = "send"` handles a persistent CLI that accepts no startup prompt: Agent Manager waits until `activity_cutoff` finds its input box, then submits the prompt there (Hermes uses this). Set it to `"argument"` if a custom Hermes wrapper accepts a launch argument instead. The prompt setting only affects a new launch; revive (`v`) uses the revive commands untouched.

**MCP.** `mcp = "claude" | "codex" | "opencode" | "grok" | "gemini" | "hermes" | "command-code" | "none"` picks how the agent-manager MCP server is registered into the tool's sessions (see [MCP](usage.md#mcp-how-agents-discover-these-commands)). An empty value uses the tool's config key when it names a known style. Hermes registration needs its MCP SDK, an optional part of the Hermes install: when it is missing, the spawn stops and a dialog offers the `pip install mcp` line for the Python that runs Hermes, read from `hermes --version`. The same dialog appears when the CLI itself is missing, using the same install hint as a missing tmux or git. Where that hint is an agent CLI's vendor installer, `c` copies that command and `i` runs it in a shell tab, then repeats the spawn once it has succeeded.

**Your config wins.** A field you left out is filled from the built-in defaults on every launch, and a tool missing from the file is added whole, so an older config picks up new capabilities. A field you do have is yours and stays: a `[tools.pi]` block that already carries a `rules = [...]` array keeps that array even after a release ships better rules for Pi. That is what you want for a block you tuned, and it is the first thing to check when a tool the manager supports reads its status wrong.

**When a status looks wrong.** Delete the `rules` array from that tool's block (or the whole `[tools.<name>]` block) and relaunch: the block comes back on the current built-in rules. To see what the rules are being matched against, read the pane the way the poller does — `tmux -L agentmgr capture-pane -p -t am_<id>` — and compare it with the patterns in your block. A CLI that changed its output in a new version is worth [an issue](https://github.com/YoanWai/agent-manager/issues/new/choose) with that pane text and the CLI's version, since the built-in rules then need updating for everyone.

## Key bindings

Two tables in config.toml name the keys: `[keybindings.session]` for the keys the manager keeps inside a session, and `[keybindings.list]` for the keys of its own list. Each action takes one key or a list of keys, `"none"` turns it off, and an action left out keeps its default. One key serves one action within a table: a key you name is yours, and an action that only held it by default gives it up and is left without one.

### Inside a session

Inside a session, attached or focused, the manager keeps a few keys for itself and hands every other key to the agent. A `[keybindings.session]` table moves those keys, so one that collides with a key your agent uses can go elsewhere or be given back:

```toml
[keybindings.session]
detach = ["ctrl+q", "f9"]   # back to the manager; one key or a list
review = "alt+r"            # open the session's diff review
editor = "none"             # f3 reaches the agent instead
```

The actions are `detach` (default `["ctrl+q", "ctrl+\\"]`), `review` (default `"ctrl+r"`) and `editor` (default `"f3"`). `"none"` hands the key to the agent like any other. Session keys are written as `ctrl+<letter>` (the symbols `@ \ ] ^ _` too), `alt+<letter or digit>`, or `f1` to `f12`. A key with no modifier is refused here, since it would take a character away from the agent, as are `ctrl+i`, `ctrl+m` and `ctrl+[`, which the terminal sends as tab, enter and escape. Bubble Tea, the framework the manager is built on, cannot read `ctrl+shift` combinations yet, so those are out for now. `detach` always keeps at least one key: it is the way back from a focused session.

### In the list

Every key the list answers to is an action in `[keybindings.list]`, listed in full here and in the picker under Settings: `up`, `down`, `open`, `attach`, `step_in`, `step_out`, `reorder_up`, `reorder_down`, `new_session`, `terminal`, `new_group`, `fork`, `prompt`, `review`, `mark_idle`, `rename`, `move`, `editor`, `restart`, `kill`, `kill_all`, `revive`, `revive_all`, `archive`, `restore`, `delete`, `search`, `filter`, `archived`, `empty_groups`, `fold_all`, `resize`, `settings`, `messages`, `help` and `quit`.

```toml
[keybindings.list]
new_session = "N"           # n is free for something else
prompt = ["space", "p"]     # two keys open the quick prompt
quit = "none"               # ctrl+c still quits
```

A list key is a plain character (`n`, `N`, `?`, `|`), a key name (`space`, `enter`, `tab`, `backspace`, `delete`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `home`, `end`, `pgup`, `pgdn`), `shift+` an arrow or tab, or the `ctrl+`, `alt+` and `f1` to `f12` forms above. A shifted letter is written as its capital. `esc` and `ctrl+c` are not keys a table can take: `esc` cancels everywhere and `ctrl+c` always quits. `settings` keeps at least one key, so the picker stays reachable. The footer, the `?` key map and the empty-list hints all read the table, so a moved key is named where it moved to.

### The picker

Settings (`s` by default) edits both tables: the **keybindings** row opens one picker, the session keys first and the manager's below them, where `↵` binds the key you press next, `a` adds a second key to an action, `d` turns the action off, and `r` names what would move and asks, then puts the shipped keys back on every action. A key its table cannot take is refused there with the reason the file would give. Leaving the picker writes each table you changed back into your config.toml, one line per action, keeping the rest of the file as you wrote it, comments included, and puts the keys to work at once, so no restart is needed.

The same table drives a full-screen attach, where the keys are tmux bindings on the `agentmgr` server, and focus mode, where the manager reads them itself; the session footer, the focus footer and the `?` key map all name whatever the table says. The bindings are reinstalled on every launch and every session create, so a change to the table takes effect when the manager next starts, running sessions included.

State is stored next to the config in `state.db` (SQLite).

## Right-to-left text

Hebrew and Arabic rows are painted as the cells they occupy, the same on every host. A terminal that runs its own bidirectional layout, iTerm2's right-to-left support or WezTerm's `bidi_enabled`, reorders those rows itself; turn that support off to read the frame in the columns Agent Manager paints.
